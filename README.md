# Batch Heal and Clean

This used to be a batch script to fix common pc problems.

As of now - it belongs to a museum.

The only reason it is here is because this was the first programming experience I ever had - that was 5 years ago.

It was initially hosted on [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/batch-heal-clean) and is still there.

The batch file is a bit useless now but I'd love it if you could have a look at the [documentation](https://github.com/dufferzafar/batch-heal/blob/master/Readme.pdf), which I wrote in MS Word back then and used god-knows-what to convert it into the beautiful PDF it is.
